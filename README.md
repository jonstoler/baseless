# baseless

An intentionally non-compliant [base16](http://chriskempson.com/projects/base16/) builder.

Unlike a standard builder, baseless does not download schemes and templates from git but instead simply reads schemes and templates from the directory tree. (You can, of course, continue to use git to manage these directories, if you like.)
